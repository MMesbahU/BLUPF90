# How do I calculate the SE with BLUPF90?

You can calculate the SE of h2 and genetic correlations using AIReml. 

It requires using the inverse of the AI matrix and getting partial derivatives. It's derived in a help file by Shogo Tsuruta. 

I created a help file that is understandable to new students with R code.
