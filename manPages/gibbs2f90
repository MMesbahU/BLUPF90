.SH NAME
\fBgibbs2f90\fR \-\- gibbs sampler to sample correlated effects jointly 




.SH DESCRIPTION
gibbs2f90 is a modification of gibbs1f90 to sample correlated effects jointly. This modification 
.br
results in better mixing for models with correlated effects such as maternal or random-regression 
.br
models. Memory requirements and CPU time per round are somewhat higher than in gibbs1f90.
.LP
	-- See renumf90 man page for help setting up the parameter file
.br
		Output as renf90.par
.LP
	-- See PREGSF90 with genotypes (SNP) for options.




.SH BASICS
Make sure that there is at least 1 non-missing value in the traits.
.br
	So if you have a 3 trait model, at least 1 of the traits much be non-zero (or whatever your
.br
		missing value is set as.
.br
	If you are running a single trait with 0's in that column, gibbs will stop.
.br
Set the number of samples and length of burn-in
.br
	This becomes a bit of an art. If it's the first run, guess 10000 samples and 0 for a burn-in.
.br
		Several runs may be desired to figure out the convergence.
.br
Give n to store every n-th sample.
.br
	Gibbs samples are usually highly correlated, so you do not have to keep all samples. 
.br
		Maybe every 10th, 20th, 50th.
.br
Run postgibbsf90 to check convergence and to calculate posterior means and SD.  





.SH OPTIONS
.B OPTION fixed_var all 1 2 3
.br
	All solutions and posterior means and SD for effects 1, 2, and 3 are stored in 
.br
	"all_solutions" and in "final_solutions" every round using fixed variances. 
.br
	Without numbers, all solutions for all effects are stored.
.br
.B OPTION fixed_var mean 1 2 3
.br
	Posterior means and SD for effects 1, 2, and 3 stored in "final_solutions".
.br
.B OPTIONS solutions all 1 2 3
.br
	All solutions and posterior means and SD for effects 1, 2, and 3 are stored in
.br
	"all_solutions" and in "final_solutions" every round. 
.br
	Without numbers, all solutions for all effects are stored.
.br
.B OPTION solution mean 1 2 3
.br
	Posterior means and SD for effects 1, 2, and 3 stored in "final_solutions".
.br
.B OPTION cont 10000
.br
	10000 is the number of samples run previously when restarting the program from the last run.
.br
.B OPTION prior eff1 db1 eff2 db2 ... effn dbn -1 dbres
.br
	effx = effect number
.br
	dbx  = degree of belief for that random effect
.br
	NOTE: -1 = residual variance
.br
	The (co)variance priors are specified in the parameter file.
.br
	Degree of belief for all random effects should be specified using the following structure:
.br
		OPTION prior 5 2 -1 5  
.br
			In this example 2 is the degree of belief for the 5th effect, and 5 is the degree
.br
				of belief for the residual.
.br
.B OPTION seed 123 321
.br
	Two seeds for a random number generator can be specified.
.br
.B OPTION SNP_file snp
.br
	Specify the SNP file name to use genotype data.
