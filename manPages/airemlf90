.SH NAME
\fBairemlf90\fR \-\- Average Information Criterion REML




.SH DESCRIPTION
Modification of REMLF90 for estimating variances with the Average-information algorithm. Initially written by Shogo Tsuruta in 03/99-07/99.
.LP
AIREMLF90 uses a second derivative REML algorithm with extra heuristics, as is described in Jensen et al. (1996-7). For most models, it converges in far fewer rounds than EM-REML as implemented in REMLF90. While typically REMLF90 takes 50-300 rounds ot converge. AIREMLF90 converges in 5-15 rounds and to a higher accuracy. For selected models, AI-REML may fail to converge when the covariance matrix is close to non-positive definite. Adjust sensitivity of the program by setting the appropriate tolerance and setting good starting values. The final results will be saved in "airemlf90.log".

.SH OPTIONS
OPTION \fBconv_crit\fR 1d-9
.br
	Convergence criterion
.br
	** Default: 1d-10
.br
OPTION \fBmaxrounds\fR #
.br
	Maximum rounds. When the number < 2, the program calculates BLUP without iterating REML.
.br
	** Default: 5000
.br
OPTION \fBEM-REML\fR #
.br
	Run EM-REML (REMLF90) for the first "#" rounds to get initial variances within the parameter space (default 0)
.br
	** Default: 0
.br
OPTION \fBuse_yams\fR 
.br
	Run the program with YAMS (Yet Another MME Solver, modified FSPAK). The computing time can be dramatically improved.
.br
OPTION \fBtol\fR 1d-12
.br
	Tolerance (or precision) for positive definite matrices and g-inverse subroutines.
.br
	** Default: 1d-14
.br
	- Convergence may be much faster by changing this value.
.br
OPTION \fBsol se\fR 
.br
	Store solutions and SE's
.br
OPTION \fBresidual\fR 
.br
	y-hat and residuals will be included in "yhat_residual" file.
.br
OPTION \fBmissing\fR #
.br
	Specify the missing value
.br
	** Default: 0
.br
OPTION \fBSNP_file\fR snp
.br
	Specify the SNP file name to use genotype data.
.LP
Heterogeneous residual variances for a single trait
.br
OPTION \fBhetres_pos\fR 10 11
.br
	Specify positions (columns) of covariables (trait first)
.br
OPTION \fBhetres_pol\fR 4.0 0.1 0.1
.br
	Intial values of coefficients for heterogeneous residual variances. Use
.br
	ln(a0, a1, a2, ...) to make these values. When teh number of positions = the 
.br
	number of polynomials, the regressions do not include the intercept (e.g., linear spline).
.LP
Heterogeneous residual variances for multiple traits (the convergence will be very slow)
.br
OPTION \fBhetres_pos\fR 10 10 11 11
.br
	Specify positions of covariables (trait first).
.br
OPTION \fBhetres_pol\fR 4.0 4.0 0.1 0.1 0.01 0.01
.br
	Initial values of coefficients for heterogeneous residual variances using ln(a0, a1, a2, ...)
.br
	to make these values (trait first). "4.0 4.0" are the intercept for first and second traits.
.br
	"0.1 0.1" could be linear and "0.01 0.01" could be quadratic. To transform back to the
.br
	original scale, sue exp(a0 + a1*X1 + a2*X2).









.SH OUTPUT
airemlf90.log
.br
	This will be the output round by round.
.br
SOLUTIONS
.br
	Column 1 = Type
.br
	Column 2 = Effect
.br
	Column 3 = Solution to fixed/random effects	
.br
	Column 4 = Standard error (if "OPTION sol se" is specified)
