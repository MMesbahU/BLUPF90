# man pages for BLUPF90 programs

## Instructions

### Mac OS X:

- Find a directory that is in your manpath already (I cannot figure out how to 
alter the manpath on Mac OS X as easy as some people seem to say online, help wanted...)
- 
``` 
  $ sudo cp name_of_file /usr/local/share/man/man1/name_of_file.1
```
-
```
  $ sudo gzip /usr/local/share/man/man1/name_of_file.1
```

### Linux machines:

I need to find a manpath to put these in. 

## How to use

### Mac OS X:

They should be availbe with the man command:

```
  $ man renumf90
```

### Linux:

Same, just run:

```
  $ man renumf90
```

or whatever man page you are interested in.
